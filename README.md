# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)

The goal is simple in concept, just difficult in execution.
Gvien these four csv files, we're tasked withusing our skills to properly work through the data,
and properly analyze it with the skills we've been cultivating in the bootcamp so far.

## Process
### (your step 1)
The first step is the biggest one, to get the given csv files processed into a database 
and then cleaned to a useable state to properly analyze it.
### (your step 2)
Once properly cleaned, the next step is to process it through some good QA testing, ensure that everything is where it's supposed to be, pointing to where it should be, and nothing is where it shouldn't be

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

This data was the first time everything in the reading material all came together. I think I used just about every SQL transformation and analysis statement we've covered so far. 

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

With so many moving parts and such massive tables to work with, it was a real pain to import the csvs into tables and then even trickier to clean. Especially since a couple questions were based on columns I removed in cleaning. Luckily, my cleaned tables were views, so I still had the original data.

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)

I think I could have done more QA, and maybe with some extra help made cleaner queries to answer the questions. Maybe I could have even written one more question myself, but that I'm not so sure of. I'm not very creative.
